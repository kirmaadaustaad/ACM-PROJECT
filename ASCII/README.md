Asciify : ASCII Art Generator
ASCII(American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a common encoding format used for representing strings and text data in computers.

But..what if we use this for something other than text?

How about images? Images on your terminal!

Goal
Convert images(jpg/png) to ASCII encoded strings, that look like the image.
